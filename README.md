# Lean Syntax Highlight for Obsidian

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) providing live syntax highlight for the [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) programming language.

## Installation

- Open Settings > Third-party plugin
- Make sure Safe mode is **off**
- Click Browse community plugins
- Search for "Lean Syntax Highlight"
- Click Install
- Once installed, close the community plugins window and activate the newly installed plugin

Note: This plugin is mostly a fork from [cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian](https://github.com/deathau/cm-editor-syntax-highlight-obsidian) and from [obsidian-mlir-syntax-highlight](https://github.com/Lewuathe/obsidian-mlir-syntax-highlight),
but only providing support for Lean (as other languages are already natively supported by Obsidian).
